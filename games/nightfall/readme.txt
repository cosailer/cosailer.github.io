I am no map professional, and this is my first attempt to create something.
I just modified the official map wirld animal park to this puzzle type mission,
you are suppose to make use of the environment to complete
objectives. it plays similar to the campain mission "Dark Night". Only this one is more
complicated, with lots of hidden clues for you to find out.

>> HINTS

1, veatern chrono can double its attack range.
2, vertern slave miner can brake through walls.
3, the nuetrual units will auto attack you, but your units
   will not auto attack them, so be really careful.
4, The magnitron can lift vetrcles
5, the propaganda truck can load people
6, if you attack an neutral vilcle, it will try to find 
   the repair shop
7, capture the repair shop with units inside will also
   capture the unit

>> Solution Overview

if you take a look at the whole mapview file. Then its not really hard
to find out the way to destory the yuri's fortress. It is located inside
a closed harbor in the sea. The harbor is heavily guarded with anti-air,
anti-ground and anti-underwater units. Since you dont have heavy armies to go
by force, you have to fight smart.

you can find out that there is a chrono device and a ship yard on the map.
if you can obtain both, then you can build a group of subs and chrono to
the harbor and do some damage.

the chrono device will be yours once the psychic tower is destroyed. However,
the ship yard is a little difficult to get. Since it is located in water, the
only way you can capture it is through yuri prim.

In order to build a yuri prim, you need to have both yuris tech building 
and yuris barrack. You can find them on the map, but they are located on
two isolated island. Since you have the chrono device, that's not really 
an issue.

then you need to find a way to bring the engineer to capture the power
plant to supply the chrono device. And so on, each step is connected to the
rest of the steps, that's why it is a puzzel.


>> Solution Detailed Steps

0, you will see that the engineer is stuck on an island due to transfer
   error on the time machine. How to save him is one of the puzzles.

1, this objective is very easy, just order your Psi commando destory
   the psychic beacon, then it is done. just becareful of the monkeys
   that will attack you. After the building is destoryed, a crate with
   speed upgrade will be granted to the player.

2, this objective is also easy, order the Psi commando destory
   the psychic tower. be careful of the pillbox, you can destory it with
   your sniper. but be sure to level up your sniper first, by killing all
   the yuri's forces in this area.
   
   After the tower is destoryed, a crate with armor upgrade will be granted 
   to the player, and the chrono device will be yours.
   
   warning: do not engage the t-rex with your sniper, unless he is verteran

3, breaking the protection wall is not so obvious. after some observation,
   you can see that the other side of the wall is near 3 barrels. find
   someone to attack the barrel, then problem solved. However, you just
   cannot get to the other side, you can see there is a monkey at L5,
   but the psi commando cannot reach it. This can be solved by leveling up
   the psi commando, just order hime to destroy the patriot missile. Then
   the verteran psi commando will be able to reach the monkey, and break
   the barrel and the wall.
   
   after the wall is destoryed, the map will be extended, a radar will be
   shown on the lower part. your next objective is to destory it.
   
4, to destory the radar, you can use your sniper to shoot the barrels near
   it. same way to destory the sentry gun. once in the soviet radar 
   outpost, you can see two engineers, kill the secret service persenels
   first and order your psi commando to control one of the 2 engineers to 
   capture the machine shop at L8. The reason for capturing it will be 
   explained later.
   
   once the radar is destoryed, you will be granted with a crate with
   firepower upgrade.
   
5, if you want, you can try to take out the t-rex replication center
   with just a sniper and a psi commando. but there is a grand canon at
   the back of the replication center, which is impossible to destory.
   because you do not have units that can break through walls.
   
   the next part will be how to acquire unit with wall breaking abilitis.
   you can see that there is a slave miner at L9, which when upgraded to
   verteran, will have the firepower to break wall. therefore it will be
   really nice to have. However, one cannot simply control the slave miner
   with psi commando. So I will introduce another way to capture it.
   
   The theory is that when a unit is being repaired, capture the whole repair
   shop will also capture the unit that is being repaired. You can see that
   there is a repair shop at L10. with the one engineer remaining at the
   radar outpost at L7, you can capture the slave miner.
   
   Use the slave miner to destroy the prison fence around the 4 engineers in
   chrono outpost at L4. So that they can easily move to the repair shop.
   then order the slave miner to attack one of the engineers once then stop.
   the civilian engineer will then try to take back the repair shop you just
   captured. Now the repairt shop is ready to capture another unit.
   
   using the same method, you can capture the magnitron and the truck, the 
   truck has loading ability and can carry 5 person.
   
   warning: after the repair shop being captured by civilian engineer, it
   will have the ability to attack nearby units! be careful when you move
   your engineers around it.
   
   after this, you will have a slave miner, a magnitron, a truck, a sinper
   and a psi commando. load your infantry into the truck and take them to
   the t-rex replication center at L11. move slave miner to the grand cannon
   blind spot and destory it. then destory the replication buildings.
   remember to upgrade your units along the way.
   
   when all 4 replication centers are destoryed, the whole map will be
   revealed. and the new puzzel awaits.
   
6, after the long prepration in 5, you will find out that there is no bridge
   to get to the time machine base at the right side. to use the chrono device
   you need power. however, to capture power, you need to use chrono device?
   
   please take a very deep look at L12, with the magnitron, you can carry your
   units to the other side. please check my youtube video if you do not understand
   how this is done.
   
   when you move your slave miner and a truck with sniper and psi commando to the
   front gate of the time machine base. you can see the distance between two tesla
   coil is too wide. you dont need to engage them to be able to get inside base.
   but there is still a grand cannon. kill it by moving your slave miner to its
   blind spot. then destory the patriot missile so that you can use psi commando
   to control the sige chopper, and use the chopper to destory the tesla coil
   closet to the tech power plant. then order the chopper to kill himself. and now
   control the engineer close by to capture the power plant. Now we have power.
   
   once the power plant is captured, a crate with some money is grant to you.
   
   repair the power plant to full health, now the chrono device is online. now you
   realize that the power is just enough for the chrono device, if we capture
   another building that uses power, the chrono deivce will offline. As disscussed
   earlier to build the yuri prim. two engineers must capture the two buildings at
   the same time, if you captuer the yuri tech building first, then there is no
   chrono device to send engineer to capture the other building. so you can follow
   the steps below to build the yuri prim.
   
   
   (1 chrono your truck to the engineer at the beginning and load it. in the 
   meantime, you can use your magnitron to destory the psychic tower and the 
   sentry gun in yuris tech outpost at L16.
   
   (2 chrono your verteran slave miner to L16 to destory the wall around
   the tech buiding.
   
   (3 chrono the truck back to L16 and unload engineer.
   
   (4 chrono the magnitron to yuris infantry outpost at L17 and destory all the
   defensive structures.
   
   (5 chrono the truck with psi commando to L17 and control the engineer to
   capture the barrack.
   
   (6 at L16, order the engineer to capture the tech building.
   
   (7 now train the yuri prim and load hime in the truck, if you want to,
   you can also train an engineer to capture the hospital at L18.
   
   (8 sell the tech building and the barrack, now you have power to chrono your
   truck to the time machine base at L14.
   
   with yuri prim, you can use it to capture the ship yard at L20 and build 9
   submarines then you can chrono them to the back side of yuris power plant
   at L22. destory yuris power plant, then all yuris defensive structure are
   useless. then clear the inside of the harbor with your submarines. leave
   the grand cannons intact.
   
   if you are running low on cash, chrono your slave miner to the gem mine
   at L19.
   
   build a stransport and load yuri prim in it, and chrono it to the specific
   unload point at L24.
   
   now use yuri prime to control the grand cannon, sell your chrono device to
   give power to the cannon, then order your cannon to destory yuri's fortress.
   
   you are victories!!
